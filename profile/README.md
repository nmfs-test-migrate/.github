## A GH org to test migration into Enterprise Cloud

Fork or clone repos from your GitHub orgs to test what happens when this org is migrated into Enterprise

* No non-NOAA collaborators for now since we don't want to eat up licenses
* Repos that do less common things, like used to post to Posit Connect or have unusual GitHub Actions are good
* Create projects or issues

## Repos on here now

* nmfs-test-migrate a Jekyll based page with lots of dependencies
* rCAX GitHub action builds a pkgdown page
* VRData nothing that special
